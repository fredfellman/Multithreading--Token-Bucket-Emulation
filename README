| GRADING |
+---------+

Basic running of the code : 100 out of 100 pts

Missing required section(s) in README file : None
Cannot compile : (Compilation successful)
Compiler warnings : (None, used -Wall flag in the Makefile submitted by me for warmup2 executable)
"make clean" : (executed successfully and all the object and executable files are removed)
Segmentation faults : (None encountered while running all the grading guidelines)
Separate compilation : (Generated two seperate files my402list.c and warmup2.c, their object files are linked via Makefile submitted by me. Not much user generated .h files are used)
Using busy-wait : (Checked by using top statement, it does not take high CPU percentage, more than 1%)
Handling of commandline arguments:
    1) -n : (yes)
    2) -lambda : (yes)
    3) -mu : (yes)
    4) -r : (yes)
    5) -B : (yes)
    6) -P : (yes)
Trace output :
    1) regular packets: (regular packets have exactly 6 lines of trace and contain correct information)
    2) dropped packets: (1 line of trace and contain correct information)
    3) removed packets: (contain correct removal information)
    4) token arrival (dropped or not dropped): (have 1 line of trace and contain correct information)
Statistics output :
    1) inter-arrival time : (correct)
    2) service time : (correct)
    3) number of customers in Q1 : (correct)
    4) number of customers in Q2 : (correct)
    5) number of customers at a server : (correct)
    6) time in system : (correct)
    7) standard deviation for time in system : (correct)
    8) drop probability : (correct)
Output bad format : (the format is strictly followed as stated in the problem statement)
Output wrong precision for statistics (should be 6-8 significant digits) : (%.6g is used for 6 significant digits)
Large service time test : (handled)
Large inter-arrival time test : (handled)
Tiny inter-arrival time test : (handled)
Tiny service time test : (handled)
Large total number of customers test : (handled)
Large total number of customers with high arrival rate test : (handled)
Dropped tokens test : (handled)
Cannot handle <Cntrl+C> at all (ignored or no statistics) : (handled)
Can handle <Cntrl+C> but statistics way off : (handled)
Not using condition variables and do some kind of busy-wait : (No)
Synchronization check : (Used mutex while making changes in global variables)
Deadlocks : (None encountered)

Comments on design decisions: Divided the code in functions and modules. Tried not to use many inbuilt functions and checked the return value of the functions when used.
Comments on deviation from spec: Followed all the mentioned specifications in the problem statement
